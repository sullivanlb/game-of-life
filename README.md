# Game of life

The game of life is a "zero player game", so it does not require the intervention of the player during its progress. It is a cellular automaton, a model where each state leads mechanically to the next state according to pre-established rules.
The game takes place on a two-dimensional grid, theoretically infinite (but of finite length and width), whose squares - called "cells", by analogy with living cells - can take on two distinct states: "alive" or "dead".

A cell has eight neighbors, which are the horizontally, vertically and diagonally adjacent cells.

At each stage, the evolution of a cell is entirely determined by the state of its eight neighbors in the following way:

- a dead cell with exactly three living neighbors becomes alive (it is born);
- a living cell with two or three living neighbors stays alive, otherwise it dies.

# How do it works ?

- Click on each cell that you want to make alive or just click on the random button.
- Then you can click the Start button to begin de progression beside that you can also change the delay between two state.
- And stop the progression by clicking on the stop button.

Simple as that :)
